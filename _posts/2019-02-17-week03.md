### **Browser Extension:**

I ran into some problems (wierd ones) with browser extension when it come to initiating communication between context scripts and background file. I spent some hours on fixing the issue but unfortunately wasn't able to tackle it so I seeked help of my team mates. My team mates were responsive but busy. The communication was done there a Fcebook Messenger and we didn't meet in person. There is is still some stuff that needs to be completed.
