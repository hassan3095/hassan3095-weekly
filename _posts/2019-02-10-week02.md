### **Contrbutions:**
I setup the repository for our browser extension with files like Licence and Contributing.

### **Status on Browser Extension:**
We setup the related HTML and JS files. The timer works but there were some reported bugs so we have to fix it. The next step will be to initiate communication between context scripts and background file.

### **Git:**
I learned how to effectively use issues with branches to maintain the updated codebase with different working branches.
