# **Introduction:**  
I have selected Yarn for my project evaluaton. Dealing with different packages and their dependencies has always been a grey area for me and I have had a first hand experience of how effectively Yarn does a perfect job in managing everything.

## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ https://yarnpkg.com/en/


__What is the purpose of the project:__ Fast: Yarn caches every package it has downloaded, so it never needs to download the same package again. It also does almost everything concurrently to maximize resource utilization. This means even faster installs.

Reliable: Using a detailed but concise lockfile format and a deterministic algorithm for install operations, Yarn is able to guarantee that any installation that works on one system will work exactly the same on another system.

Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.
